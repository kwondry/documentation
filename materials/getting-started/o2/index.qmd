> Working with the HMS O2 cluster

## Introduction to O2

O2 is the high performance computing (HPC) cluster maintained by Harvard Medical School. O2 official documentation is located here: 

- [O2 Cluster Documentation](https://harvardmed.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/O2/overview){target="_blank"}\
- [O2 Status (Maintenance Updates and Outages)](https://harvardmed.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/O2/pages/1600651306/O2+Cluster+Status){target="_blank"}\

## Setting up your O2 account

### Obtain your O2 account

Kwon Lab is an "off-quad" Harvard Medical School affiliated lab that uses O2 computing services. This section was created using the official [O2 documentation](https://harvardmed.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/O2/pages/1918304257/How+to+request+or+retain+an+O2+account){target="_blank"} as reference.\

1. Submit [PPMS form](https://ppms.us/harvard-hms/vdoc/?cont=on&pf=11&docid=30) and wait for RC Core admin ([rccore@hms.harvard.edu](mailto:rccore@hms.harvard.edu)) for approval. Approval notifications are sent to email submitted in PPMS form. 
2. Sign the HMS RC Core user agreement that is sent via email (requires PI to co-sign)

### Accessing O2

Using your computer's terminal, use the following command to access O2 and enter your credentials accordingly.

```{python}
#| eval: false
ssh <hms_id>@o2.hms.harvard.edu

```

### Setting up 2-Factor Authentication with Duo

O2 login requires 2-Factor Authentication and it is recommended to execute this through the Duo app, which can be installed on your phone.

1. [Download the app](https://it.hms.harvard.edu/duo-mobile-app) on phone
2. Email [itservicedesk\@hms.harvard.edu](mailto:itservicedesk@hms.harvard.edu) or call 617-432-2000 to ask HMS IT to register and connect your HMS account with Duo. 
3. Logging into O2 by default asks you to pick a Duo authentication method (push, call or text). Set your Duo app to either send a push or call your phone each time automatically. DO NOT set text as your default. 

(On the login node) Run the following on O2 terminal: 

For push: (recommended, but only if you already have Duo push!)

```{python}
#| eval: false
echo 'export DUO_PASSCODE=push' >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

For phone call:

```{python}
#| eval: false
echo 'export DUO_PASSCODE=phone' >> $HOME/.bashrc
```



### Setup passwordless login (SSH keys)

Please refer to SSH keys tutorial [here](https://harvardmed.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/O2/pages/1600651365/How+to+Generate+SSH+Keys){target="_blank"}\


## Getting oriented with O2

Save all your files into one of the two locations: 

1. `/n/groups/kwon/<your_name>`    Your own folder within the Kwon Lab group folder and main storage location.  
2. `/n/groups/scratch/<first_letter_of_hms_id>/<hms_id>`    Scratch directory is for temporary storage and files are deleted in 45 days.    

### Request access to the `/n/groups/kwon/` groups folder

To request access, email [rchelp@hms.harvard.edu](mailto:rchelp@hms.harvard.edu) to ask for access to the group folder `/n/groups/kwon` on O2. Please copy [dkwon\@mgh.harvard.edu](mailto:dkwon@mgh.harvard.edu) and [jelsherbini\@mgh.harvard.edu](mailto:jelsherbini@mgh.harvard.edu).

Use the following command in the O2 terminal to access the Kwon Lab folder and make a folder under your own name:
```{python}
#| eval: false
cd /n/groups/kwon/
mkdir <your name>
```

To access your own folder within the Kwon Lab group folder on the O2 terminal:
```{python}
#| eval: false
cd /n/groups/kwon/<your name>
```

### Making a scratch directory

Note: the scratch directory is for **TEMPORARY STORAGE**. All files in scratch are automatically deleted **45 days** after their last modification date. Everything you want to keep needs to be moved to your folder in `/n/groups/kwon/<your name>`.

**(On the login node)** Run the following on O2 terminal:
```{python}
#| eval: false
/n/cluster/bin/scratch_create_directory.sh
```

To access scratch directory:
```{python}
#| eval: false
cd /n/groups/scratch/users/<first_letter_of_hms_id>/<hms_id>
```
