### Requesting access to the /n/groups/kwon groups folder

To request access, email `rchelp@hms.harvard.edu` to ask for access to the group folder /n/groups/kwon on O2. Please copy dkwon@mgh.harvard.edu and jelsherbini@mgh.harvard.edu as well. 





### Make a scratch directory.

Note, the scratch directory is automatically cleaned every 30 days, this is **ONLY FOR TEMPORARY STORAGE**. Everything you want to keep needs to be moved to your folder in /n/groups/kwon/(your name).

(ON LOGIN NODE) Run the following on O2: /n/cluster/bin/scratch_create_directory.sh
