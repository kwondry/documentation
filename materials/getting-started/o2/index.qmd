> Instructions for getting access and onto O2

### Ask for access to /n/groups/kwon

email rchelp@hms.harvard.edu, copy dkwon@mgh.harvard.edu and jelsherbini@mgh.harvard.edu, ask for access to the group folder /n/groups/kwon on o2.

### Get Duo Push for Android / IOS  and register with hms

first download the app : https://it.hms.harvard.edu/duo-mobile-app

then, email [itservicedesk@hms.harvard.edu](mailto:itservicedesk@hms.harvard.edu). or call 617-432-2000 to ask HMS IT to get registered with Duo

### Set default 2-factor authentication option to call or push:

For push (recommended, but only if you already have duo push!):

echo 'export DUO_PASSCODE=push' >> $HOME/.bashrc

For phone

echo 'export DUO_PASSCODE=phone' >> $HOME/.bashrc

DO NOT set text as your default

### Setup passwordless login (ssh keys):

### Make a scratch directory.

Note, the scratch directory is automatically cleaned every 30 days, this is **truly truly truly for temporary storage**. **Everything you want to keep** needs to be moved to **your folder in /n/groups/kwon**

Run the following on o2: /n/cluster/bin/scratch3_create.sh
