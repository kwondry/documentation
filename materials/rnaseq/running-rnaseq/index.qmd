> Running the rnaseq pipeline


#### Run the kraken pipeline
Each sample takes up to a couple hours, but each sample runs independently on the cluster\
```
sbatch submit_kraken.sh
```

#### Run the nfcore pipeline 

```
conda activate nfcore
nf-core download rnaseq
sbatch submit_nfcore_rnaseq.sh
```

#### Move the results to your lab folder in /n/groups
```
salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv
salmon.merged.gene_tpms.tsv
Nfcore_rnaseq_multiqc_report.html
```

If you are in your smartseq_kraken-main folder:
```
cp results/nfcore/star_salmon/salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv results/nfcore/star_salmon/salmon.merged.gene_tpm.tsv results/nfcore/multiqc/star_salmon/nfcore_rnaseq_multiqc_report.html /n/groups/kwon/(your_group_folder_name)
```
