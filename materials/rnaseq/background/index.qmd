### Introduction to the pipeline
This pipeline quantifies RNA-sequenced reads relative to genes/transcripts in the genome and normalizes the resulting data. It uses `Kraken2` for filtering human reads and `nf-core/rnaseq` for the core trimming, alignments, and quantification. It does not compare the samples statistically, so for downstream analyses, the output files from this pipeline can be analysed directly in statistical environments like R.

### Inputs
This pipeline takes a sample sheet and fastq files (ideally in `/n/groups/kwon/data1/sequencing_run_archive_DO_NOT_EDIT/`) as input and works for both single and paired-end reads.


### Outputs
QC report, gene counts, normalized gene counts, QC reports, etc.
