## Download the data for the workshop

There are five files to download and place in your R project folder.

- [`metadata.csv`](../../datasets/metadata.csv)

Each row of this table is a well on a plate that was measured. This has the bacterial isolate that was tested, the growth condition (long chain fatty acid) and the concentration of the long chain fatty acid.

`plate_id` – an identifier of which plate was measured  
`row` – row of the plate (A-H)  
`column` – column of the plate (1-12)  
`bug` – the isolate/species that was tested in this well 
`condition` - which long chain fatty acid (LCFA) was added 
`conc` - what was the concentration of the LCFA in this well?


- [`plate_1_data.csv`](../../datasets/plate_1_data.csv)
- [`plate_2_data.csv`](../../datasets/plate_2_data.csv)
- [`plate_3_data.csv`](../../datasets/plate_3_data.csv)
- [`plate_4_data.csv`](../../datasets/plate_4_data.csv)

`plate_id` – an identifier of which plate was measured  
`row` – row of the plate (A-H)  
`column` – column of the plate (1-12)  
`od` - the optical density that was measured in this well. This is a measure of bacterial growth.


### Read in data

Data is often in tables, and the easiest way to store tabular data is in `csv` or `tsv` format.

`csv` - comma separated values    
`tsv` - tab separated values  

to read in data stored this way use `read_csv(filename)` or `read_tsv(filename)`

```r
metadata <- read_csv("data/metadata.csv")
```

### `bind`ing tables together

We have data from 4 different plates in separate `csv` files. Use `bind_rows` to make a single table with all the data.

```r
plate_1 <- read_csv("data/plate_1_data.csv")
plate_2 <- read_csv("data/plate_2_data.csv")
plate_3 <- read_csv("data/plate_3_data.csv")
plate_4 <- read_csv("data/plate_4_data.csv")

all_plate_data <- bind_rows(plate_1, plate_2, plate_3, plate_4)
```


### `join`ing metadata to the data

Connect the metadata to the plate reader data using `left_join`

![](images/join.svg){width=30%}
```r
joined_data <- all_plate_data %>%
  left_join(metadata)
```

### Data visualization activity

On [excalidraw.com](excalidraw.com) or pen and paper, create a visualization to answer the questions below. Check out [the data visualization  cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf) for inspiration. Think about values you'd have to compute, or if you have everything you need already in our `joined_data` table. 

Option 1: What is the spread of values you typically see in the no media controls for different concentrations of LCFA? *Bonus: are there any effects of where the well is on the plate with the values measured?*

Option 2: What is the typical growth in the media of the different bugs without any LCFA? 

Option 3: How do the different LCFAs tested impact the growth of *L. crispatus*? 

Option 4: Are there any batch effects between plates? (What conditions are measured on multiple plates, and what conditions are only on one plate?)
