For installation instructions, visit here.\n\n\nData\nYour sequencing data should be uploaded onto O2.\n\n\nDownloading the pipeline to your scratch folder\nAfter logging onto O2 via a terminal, we can download the pipeline with the following commands.\n\n# Accessing your scratch folder on O2\ncd /n/scratch/users/{first_initial}/{hms_username}\n\n# Downloading the pipeline\nwget https://github.com/kwondry/smartseq_kraken/archive/refs/heads/main.zip\n\n# Unzip and rename the folder\nunzip main.zip -d my_new_rnaseq_run\n\nYou will now have a my_new_rnaseq_run folder that contains all the required scripts and files.\n\n\n\nAdding your samples\nDownload a sample sheet here and add your samples with the corresponding filepaths. You can edit the raw csv in any editor you’d like and save as csv. Columns are named sample, fastq_1, fastq_2, strandedness with fastq_1 being the forward reads and fastq_2 for the reverse reads. If sequences are single-end, leave the fastq_2 column empty. The fastq files should be within /n/groups/kwon/data1/sequencing_run_archive_DO_NOT_EDIT/{your sequencing run}.\n\nNext, upload your sample sheet onto O2.

The run time can range from a couple of hours to a few days. Additional information about the pipeline can be found here.\n\nmamba activate nfcore\nnf-core download rnaseq\nsbatch submit_nfcore_rnaseq.sh\n\nFollowing completion of the nfcore pipeline, you should see a results/nfcore folder that has QC, alignments, and gene counts for the samples.

It uses Kraken2 for filtering human reads and nf-core/rnaseq for the core trimming, alignments, and quantification. It does not compare the samples statistically, so for downstream analyses, the output files from this pipeline can be analysed directly in statistical environments like R.\n\n\nInputs\nThis pipeline takes a sample sheet and fastq files (ideally in /n/groups/kwon/data1/sequencing_run_archive_DO_NOT_EDIT/) as input and works for both single and paired-end reads.\n\n\nOutputs\nQC report, gene counts, normalized gene counts, QC reports, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits to Kraken2 and nf-core/rnaseq",
